# DotMotion_Analysis
This R code was used to analyze data from 2 task switching experiments
using linear mixed models with random intercepts only for reaction times and error rates.
The packages/libraries used are listed on top of the script.
The script generates the 2 gids with 4 barplot each. One for reaction times, one for error rates.
Feel free to contact me for any suggestions, questions or confusions.
Note that the two csv files neccecary to run the code are not uploaded yet. Will be online soon. 


hddm_plot_function script generates plots for hddm model fits
